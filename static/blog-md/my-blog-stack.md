description: "How I arrived at the stack for this blog"
---

There are lots of options for writing a blog these days. Some notable options include simply posting to an excellent website such as [Medium](https://www.medium.com), creating a wordpress site or utilising a framework such as Hugo or Jekyll on a custom stack.

### Requirements:
- Easy to write (no writing html)
- Ideally I can write plain html, css 
- As little js as possible
- No boiler plate (Ie I want control over the stack)
- Want to be extendable to have comments and likes (twitter maybe...?)
j

### NOTES:
- [example blog](https://bits.logic.inc/p/ai-is-forcing-us-to-write-good-code)
- subscriptions?
- I like to write code... So let me write the code
- Would I do it like this again?
